📊 Data Analytics Projects

Welcome to my Data Analytics portfolio! This repository contains a collection of short, beginner-to-intermediate level projects I’ve worked on as I learn and grow in the field of data analytics.

Each project focuses on developing core analytical skills using tools like Python, pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, and others. These projects explore real-world datasets and aim to extract insights through data exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

🚀 What You'll Find Here

- Clean and well-documented Jupyter notebooks
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of patterns and trends
- Basic statistical summaries and insights
- Short summaries of findings and next steps
